Beginner Level (Focus on Data Cleaning, Manipulation, and Visualization):

Customer Segmentation Analysis: Analyze customer data to identify different customer segments based on demographics, purchase history, or other relevant factors. Visualize these segments to understand customer behavior patterns. (Data Source: Public E-commerce data)
Sales Forecasting: Use historical sales data to build a model to forecast future sales. Analyze trends and seasonality to make informed predictions. (Data Source: Public retail sales data)
Website Traffic Analysis: Analyze website traffic data (e.g., Google Analytics) to understand user behavior, identify popular pages, and optimize website performance. (Data Source: Sample website traffic data)
Intermediate Level (Introduce Exploratory Analysis and Basic Modeling):

Social Media Sentiment Analysis: Analyze social media data to understand public sentiment towards a brand, product, or topic. Use sentiment analysis techniques to categorize tweets or posts as positive, negative, or neutral. (Data Source: Twitter API or public datasets)
Movie Recommendation System: Build a recommendation system to suggest movies to users based on their past viewing history or similar user preferences. (Data Source: Public movie rating datasets)
Fraud Detection Analysis: Analyze financial transactions to identify potential fraudulent activities. Develop rules or machine learning models to flag suspicious transactions. (Data Source: Simulated financial transaction data)
Advanced Level (Incorporate Machine Learning and Advanced Analytics):

Stock Price Prediction: Analyze historical stock market data and financial news to build a model for predicting stock prices. (Data Source: Stock market APIs or public financial data)
Customer Churn Prediction: Analyze customer data to identify factors that contribute to customer churn (cancellations). Build a model to predict which customers are at risk of churning and develop strategies to retain them. (Data Source: Sample customer data with churn labels)
Natural Language Processing (NLP) Text Analysis: Analyze textual data from documents, social media posts, or customer reviews. Use NLP techniques to extract insights, classify topics, or identify sentiment. (Data Source: Public text datasets)
Building Interactive Dashboards: Develop interactive dashboards that allow users to explore data in multiple dimensions, filter information, and drill down for deeper analysis. (Data Source: Any of the previous project datasets)
